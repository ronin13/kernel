# Introduction #

This project aims to reduce Linux network processing latency to below 10us and increase maximum throughput to at least 10 gigabit linerate at small packets, or 15 Mpps. These goals mainly benefit applications with low computation per packet ratio, such proxies and intrusion detection systems.

Unetq was presented at the Linux Plumbers Conference (LPC) 2011. For an overview, have a look at [the slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/pub?id=1YwkOcKJZgF6wQnUnq36IAS5dS7_ninRZ5eYaJI-yAQo&start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000).

This page is currently only a placeholder for unetq prototype patches, until they are ready to submit for comments to netdev. Get a snapshot of the code from the [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/kernel/downloads/list) page.
